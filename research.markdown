# Spectral Imaging Simulations for Planetary Surface Exploration
In preparation for the landing of Rosalind Franklin at Oxia Planum in the summer of 2023, I've been developing software to simulate the imaging chain of PanCam. Given a description of an environment, in terms of topography and material distribution, and skylight illumination conditions, the software answers the question of what will PanCam see?

# Geochemistry to Geology for ExoMars 2022: Visible to Near-Infrared Spectral Variability

My work with the Planetary Surfaces group at the Natural History Museum has the broad objective of preparing for exploitation of the multispectral sampling that the PanCam Wide Angle Cameras afford, by incorporating the prior knowledge of the landing site mineralogy, obtained from orbit, into the analysis process.

The initial phase of the project has focussed on the identification of the mineral hematite.
Obvs. put much more detail in here also.
