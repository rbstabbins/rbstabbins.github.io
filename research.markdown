<center> <h1>Spectral Imaging Simulations for Planetary Surface Exploration</h1> </center>
In preparation for the landing of Rosalind Franklin at Oxia Planum in the summer of 2023, I've been developing software to simulate the imaging chain of PanCam. Given a description of an environment, in terms of topography and material distribution, and skylight illumination conditions, the software answers the question of what will PanCam see?

My work with the Planetary Surfaces group at the Natural History Museum has the broad objective of preparing for exploitation of the multispectral sampling that the PanCam Wide Angle Cameras afford, by incorporating the prior knowledge of the landing site mineralogy, obtained from orbit, into the analysis process.
