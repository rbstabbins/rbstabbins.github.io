Write a better biography to go here - remember this is essentially a universal personal statement, should I should put some effort in to make it good.

I'm interested in how we can use robotic avatars to visually explore remote places in the solar system.
I got into this topic through a PhD in the Planetary Science Group at University College London's [Mullard Space Science Laboratory](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/mullard-space-science-laboratory), under the supervision of Professor Andrew Coates, Principal Investigator of the [PanCam](https://exploration.esa.int/web/mars/-/45103-rover-instruments?section=pancam---the-panoramic-camera) instrument for Rosalind Franklin, the [ExoMars 2022 Rover](https://exploration.esa.int/web/mars/-/48088-mission-overview).

Some of the things I spend time thinking about include light-matter interactions, detector system electronics, undersampled noisey signals, the automation of exploration, team operations, digital image processing, the perception of colour, visual cognition, and life in the universe.
