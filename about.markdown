![Venice, 2019](bienalle_poser.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

By degree classification, I'm an MSci physicist with a PhD in Planentary Science. 

Broadly, I'm interested in the problems associated with the visual exploration of remote places with robotic avatars. This means that I get to enjoy thinking about light-matter interactions, detector systems electronics, undersampled noisey signals, the automation of exploration, team operations, digital image processing, the perception of colour, visual cognition, and life in the universe.

I've spent the last few years studying for a PhD in the Planetary Science Group at University College London's [Mullard Space Science Laboratory](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/mullard-space-science-laboratory), under the supervision of Professor Andrew Coates, Principal Investigator of the [PanCam](https://exploration.esa.int/web/mars/-/45103-rover-instruments?section=pancam---the-panoramic-camera) instrument for Rosalind Franklin, the [ExoMars 2022 Rover](https://exploration.esa.int/web/mars/-/48088-mission-overview).

In summer 2019 I joined the Natural History Museum (London) as a Post-Doctoral Research Assistant, to work with Pete Grindrod and the Mineral and Planetary Sciences division. The research is funded by a UK Space Agency Aurora PDRA grant. This research will complement the time I've spent building tools to model the Forward problems associated with imaging a generic planetary surface, by plugging in the expert prior knowledge that Pete and his group derive from their geological analyses of the orbital imagery, for the specific case of the ExoMars landing site.
