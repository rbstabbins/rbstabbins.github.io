<h1>Various media made so long ago now that it's quite funny.</h1>

[How does a Theramin work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djpUqyay2qc&t){:target="_blank"}  
<!-- A video I made for some undergrad coursework, that surely has several mistakes, but someone commented that it reminded them of the 'original youtube'. My tutor never bothered watching it so I don't think it got a grade, but for the youtube comments it was worth it. Open review all the way. -->

[Some Roland JV1010 noodles](https://soundcloud.com/turinglive/sets/visits-to-the-galleries){:target="_blank"}  
<!-- During my PhD I rarely had the desire to open up Ableton at the end of the day, so I got a cheap but fully weighted MIDI piano the size of a volvo, and it came with a Roland JV1010. I never learnt to play piano, but I found the String/Brass setting No. 140 through my SP404 reverb quite cathartic. -->

[It's a Far Place, Many Light Years in Space, Where Human Feet Have Never Trod, Where Human Eyes Have Never Seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsOjADTdBbs){:target="_blank"}  
<!-- Dad was a part of Jerry Dammer's Sun Ra tribute group, Spatial AKA, and they did this magical version of I'll Wait for You, that could be reduced to some very simple triads that even I could play. I find it quite funny how I'd play this again and again, but had no idea I'd end up working in the world of planetary imaging. -->

[When I Woke Up This Morning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj9EXs4jkqY){:target="_blank"}  
<!-- A song The Black Tambourines used as a bonus track for their debut album. The kind of music I wish I'd made more of. -->

[See You Tomorrow](https://soundcloud.com/turinglive/see-you-tomorrow){:target="_blank"}  
<!-- An ode to Moonrise Kingdom. Very 2013. Resurrected when Ben of the Golden Dregs played it on a BBC 6 Music show he hosted, where he featured a number of artists of the scene in Cornwall. -->

[For the Pier Live, Penzance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXlhaKrb2nw){:target="_blank"}  
<!-- Sam and Jim are two of the greatest musicians I might ever know, and they very gracefully used to let me bring my samplers to the table and play along with their real instruments while I pressed play on mine. Sometimes my sister would also project some visuals over the top, and here all of these things were captured on film during maybe the last summer I had before I started to worry about science. -->

[Lana Del R'Amen - White Dress](https://youtu.be/Zur9ZDsHtzs?si=i96i387iF5thXVgY){:target="_blank"}
<!-- A bowl of ramen at Tsujita, singing Lana Del Rey in the Karaokekan golden mic room, DIY jungle at forestlimit. An ode to a year in Tokyo. -->

[A Sushi Donburi on Rikkyo-Dori](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_EFwKBorU476ycdWIPojcZtP4K9HrHRm&si=aiOHPDjhoyS0mPZu){:target="_blank"}
<!-- Music collected whilst living in Tokyo 2023. At lunch times I'd walk over from the Rikkyo University to one of the nearby record shops. Outlets of Coconuts Disk, Disk Union, Book Off, Tower Records were all in reach, and I'd note down the records on the walls or on promotion or in the bargain buckets and then I'd get a bowl of rice and raw fish and sit in the park and listen.  -->
