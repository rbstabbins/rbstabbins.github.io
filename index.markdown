## Introduction
Welcome to the website of Roger Blue Stabbins. I'm a Post-Doctoral Research Assistant at the Natural History Museum in London (UK), working with the PanCam Science Team to develop multispectral image capture and processing strategies in preparation for the ExoMars _Rosalind Franklin_ Rover mission.  
&nbsp;  
Previously I earned my PhD from the Mullard Space Science Laboratory, UCL, under the supervision of Prof. Andrew Coates, where I developed an and end-to-end software simulator of PanCam.
