# Introduction
Welcome to the website of Dr Roger Stabbins.  
&nbsp;  
I'm a Post-Doctoral Research Assistant with the [Planetary Surfaces Group](https://www.planetsurf.space/){:target="_blank"} of the Natural History Museum in London (UK).  
&nbsp;  
My research focuses on maximising the science return of the multispectral and stereo [PanCam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOEgsdTqdmo){:target="_blank"} imaging system for the [ExoMars Rosalind Franklin Rover mission](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Exploration/ExoMars){:target="_blank"}.  
&nbsp;  
I approach this problem from the theoretical end, by developing models and writing software to simulate the response of PanCam to a variety of environments, complementing the findings of my empirical collegues.
