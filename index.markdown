# Introduction
This is the website of Dr Roger Stabbins.
&nbsp;

I'm a JSPS Short-term Fellow at Rikkyo University (Tokyo, Japan), hosted by the Kameda Laboratory in the Department of Physics.
&nbsp;

My research focuses on maximising the science return of multispectral and stereo imaging systems for planetary surface exploration, through modelling, simulations, and laboratory and field experiments.
&nbsp;

I'm a science team member of the multispectral imaging systems for two planned planetary missions: [PanCam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOEgsdTqdmo){:target="_blank"} for the ESA [ExoMars Rosalind Franklin Rover mission](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Exploration/ExoMars){:target="_blank"}, and [OROCHI](https://earth-planets-space.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40623-021-01462-9){:target="_blank"} for the JAXA [Martian Moons Exploration mission](https://www.mmx.jaxa.jp/en/){:target="_blank"}.
