# Introduction
Welcome to the website of Dr Roger Stabbins. I'm a Post-Doctoral Research Assistant with the [Planetary Surfaces Group](https://www.planetsurf.space/){:target="_blank"} of the Natural History Museum in London (UK), working as part of the [PanCam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOEgsdTqdmo){:target="_blank"} Science Team to prepare for the [ExoMars _Rosalind Franklin_ Rover mission](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Exploration/ExoMars){:target="_blank"}.  
&nbsp;  
Previously I earned my PhD from the Mullard Space Science Laboratory, UCL, under the supervision of Prof. Andrew Coates, where I developed an end-to-end software simulator of PanCam.
