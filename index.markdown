I'm a UK Space Agency Aurora Post-Doc, hosted by Prof. Pete Grindrod with the Planetary Surfaces Group at the Natural History Museum, London.
&nbsp;

My research focuses on maximising the science return of multispectral and stereo imaging systems for planetary surface exploration, through modelling, simulations, and laboratory and field experiments.
&nbsp;

I'm a science team member of the multispectral imaging systems for two planned planetary missions: [PanCam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOEgsdTqdmo){:target="_blank"} for the ESA [ExoMars Rosalind Franklin Rover mission](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Exploration/ExoMars){:target="_blank"}, and [OROCHI](https://earth-planets-space.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40623-021-01462-9){:target="_blank"} for the JAXA [Martian Moons Exploration mission](https://www.mmx.jaxa.jp/en/){:target="_blank"}, and one current planetary mission: [CaSSIS](https://www.cassis.unibe.ch/) onboard the ESA [ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter](https://exploration.esa.int/web/mars/-/46475-trace-gas-orbiter).
